# Sandbox

## For loops templates 

```{jinja} first_ctx

    {% for k, v in topics.items() %}

    {{k}} => {{v}}
    {% endfor %}
```


## Experiments with markup

```````{jinja} scvars
{% import '_jinja/macros.html' as macros %}

Tables are created using the following code. A table has a
captionfigure points to a filename and has a caption. Optionally,
you can add a label. You can make references to a table using its
<!-- label as follows: :numref:`tab-wave-breaking`. -->

Inline equation: $z=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$.

Separate equation:

```{math} e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
```


Data driven text:
SoftConsole {{sc}}


```{math} e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
---
label: euler
---
```

Euler's identity, equation {math:numref}`euler`, was elected one of the
most beautiful mathematical formulas.


Since Pythagoras, we know that {math}`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`
